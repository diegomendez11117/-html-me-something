                    <p>
                        International Women's Day is celebrated in many countries around the world. It is a day when women are recognized for their achievements without regard to divisions, whether national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political. Since those early
                        years, International Women's Day has assumed a new global dimension for women in developed and developing countries alike. The growing international women's movement, which has been strengthened by four global United Nations women's
                        conferences, has helped make the commemoration a rallying point to build support for women's rights and participation in the political and economic arenas. We invite you to learn about the history of women’s rights and the UN's
                        contribution to the cause.

                        Assembly in London, U.K., Frieda Dalen of Norway becomes the first woman delegate to address it and Eleanor Roosevelt of U.S.A. famously reads an "open letter to the women of the world" urging for their increased involvement in
                        national and international affairs.

                        alike — should enjoy. The cornerstone for modern human rights, the Declaration together with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
                        (1966) forms the International Bill of Human Rights.

                    <p>In 1975, during International Women's Year, the UN begins commemorating International Women's Day (8 March). Two years later, the UN General Assembly officially formalizes the Day — although the first observance dates back to 28 February
                        1909, when the Socialist Party of America designated the day to honour a garment workers' strike the year prior in New York. Coinciding with International Women's Year, the first World Conference on Women takes place in Mexico,
                        19 June-2 July 1975. It is here where a 10-year World Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women is formed, following which the UN General Assembly proclaims 1976-1985 the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development
                        and Peace to implement the action plan.

                    <div class="date">December 20, 1993</div>
                    <p> The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, June 1993, takes historic steps to protect women's rights by recognizing violence against women as a human rights violation and calls for measures towards eliminating such forms of violence.
                        Subsequently, in December that year, the UN General Assembly adopts the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, making it the first international instrument to explicitly address and define forms of violence against
                        women and laying out a framework for action globally. In 1994, the UN Commission on Human Rights appoints Radhika Coomaraswamy of Sri Lanka as the first Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women to record acts of gender-based
                        violence and to make recommendations to eliminate them. Still, one in three women and girls will experience violence in their lifetimes, making it one of the most pervasive human rights violations and continues to be a priority
                        for the UN to address.

                    <p>The International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo, Egypt, in 1994 becomes a landmark moment in history when the global community reaffirms that realizing women's and girls' rights is a key driver of sustainable
                        development. Specifically, the Conference's forward-looking outcome document, also known as the 20-year ICPD Programme of Action or Cairo Consensus, articulates a new vision for population, development and well-being. It positions
                        women's empowerment at the centre of development, and places the right of women and couples to control their own fertility at the heart of population policies and programmes.

                    <p> After years of negotiations, the International Criminal Court (ICC) becomes a reality when 120 Member States vote in favour of the Rome Statute. The ICC, based in The Hague, Netherlands, is a permanent international court established
                        to try the most serious war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The court's substantive jurisdiction over sexual and gender-based violence and gender-based persecution, its gender-sensitive rules of procedure and evidence,
                        and its strong emphasis on gender balance, have been hailed as important steps forward for women's rights and gender equality in the fight against impunity.

                    <p>Taking a historic step in July 2010, the UN General Assembly creates the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) to accelerate progress on meeting the needs of women and girls worldwide. The
                        move comes as part of a UN reform agenda by merging and building on the important work of four previously distinct parts of the UN system exclusively dedicated to empowering women. Initially lead by the current President of Chile
                        Michelle Bachelet, the organization today (2015) stands as a dynamic champion for women and girls worldwide under the leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka of South Africa.

                        Expressing grave concern at human rights violations suffered by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, the UN Human Rights Council adopts the first UN resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity (17/19) in 2011. A second resolution
                        (27/32) on the same issue is adopted in 2014. Discrimination against this group is inextricably linked to their gender identity and manifests in their vulnerability to social exclusion or violence, such as "corrective rape", assaults
                        and denial of basic services.

                        In 70 years, a lot has been achieved, but much more has to be done: 800 women die everyday from preventable pregnancy-related causes; 1 in 3 women experience physical or sexual violence; women hold only 22 per cent of parliamentary seats and today account
                        for more than 60 per cent of the world's illiterate. As the Millennium Development Goals draw to a close this year and the sustainable development agenda takes off, let it be clear: Our work is far from over. Together we must and
                        can achieve gender equality. We need a Planet 50–50 by 2030, and we must Step It Up for women and girls worldwide.
