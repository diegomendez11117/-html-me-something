      <h1>History of Women’s Day</h1>
      <p>
        International Women's Day is celebrated in many countries around the
        world. It is a day when women are recognized for their achievements
        without regard to divisions, whether national, ethnic, linguistic,
        cultural, economic or political. Since those early years, International
        Women's Day has assumed a new global dimension for women in developed
        and developing countries alike. The growing international women's
        movement, which has been strengthened by four global United Nations
        women's conferences, has helped make the commemoration a rallying point
        to build support for women's rights and participation in the political
        and economic arenas. We invite you to learn about the history of women’s
        rights and the UN's contribution to the cause.

      <h3>October 24, 1945</h3>
      <h1>UN Charter: "Fundamental freedoms for all"</h1>
      <p>
        Established on 24 October 1945 to promote international co-operation
        following the devastation of World War II, the UN has since its
        inception enshrined the equal rights of men and women at the heart of
        its raison d'être. Its founding charter outlines that among its purpose
        is to promote and encourage "fundamental freedoms for all without
        distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion." Less than a year
        later during the inaugural session of the UN General Assembly in London,
        U.K., Frieda Dalen of Norway becomes the first woman delegate to address
        it and Eleanor Roosevelt of U.S.A. famously reads an "open letter to the
        women of the world" urging for their increased involvement in national
        and international affairs.

      <h1>Tracking progress: Commission on the Status of Women</h1>
      <p>
        A functional commission of the United Nations Economic and Social
        Council (ECOSOC), the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is
        established as the first global intergovernmental body exclusively
        dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of
        women. Instrumental in monitoring the status of women's rights worldwide
        and shaping global standards on gender equality, the Commission brings
        together Member States, civil society organizations and UN entities to
        assess gaps and evaluate progress on an annual basis. In the Commission,
        Member States agree on actions to accelerate the achievement of women's
        rights and empowerment.

        One giant leap for humanity: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
      </h1>
      <p>
        Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, the landmark Universal
        Declaration of Human Rights is the first global recognition that there
        are basic inalienable rights and fundamental freedoms that apply to
        every human being. Drafted as "a common standard of achievement for all
        peoples and nations," the Declaration for the first time in human
        history spells out basic civil, political, economic, social and cultural
        rights that all human beings — men and women alike — should enjoy. The
        cornerstone for modern human rights, the Declaration together with the
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) and the
        International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966)
        forms the International Bill of Human Rights.

      <h1>A time to celebrate: International Women’s Day, Year & Decade</h1>
      <p>
        In 1975, during International Women's Year, the UN begins commemorating
        International Women's Day (8 March). Two years later, the UN General
        Assembly officially formalizes the Day — although the first observance
        dates back to 28 February 1909, when the Socialist Party of America
        designated the day to honour a garment workers' strike the year prior in
        New York. Coinciding with International Women's Year, the first World
        Conference on Women takes place in Mexico, 19 June-2 July 1975. It is
        here where a 10-year World Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women
        is formed, following which the UN General Assembly proclaims 1976-1985
        the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development and Peace to
        implement the action plan.

        <h3>December 20, 1993</h3>
        <h1>Enough is enough: End violence against women</h1>
        <p>
            The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, June 1993, takes historic steps to protect women's rights by recognizing violence against women as a human rights violation and calls for measures towards eliminating such forms of violence. Subsequently, in December that year, the UN General Assembly adopts the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, making it the first international instrument to explicitly address and define forms of violence against women and laying out a framework for action globally. In 1994, the UN Commission on Human Rights appoints Radhika Coomaraswamy of Sri Lanka as the first Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women to record acts of gender-based violence and to make recommendations to eliminate them. Still, one in three women and girls will experience violence in their lifetimes, making it one of the most pervasive human rights violations and continues to be a priority for the UN to address.
